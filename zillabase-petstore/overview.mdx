## Zillabase

Zillabase is a Firebase alternative re-imagined for real-time data and asynchronous workloads. It combines a stack of streaming-native open-source tools to automatically generate an event-driven backend, complete with real-time data models, user functions, security, and APIs (both RESTFul and Async ones).

<Note>Zillabase is currently in active development. For any questions, please reach out to us on our [Slack](https://aklivitycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-sy06wvr9-u6cPmBNQplX5wVfd9l2oIQ)</Note>

## Zillabase Petstore Example

A widely used example, the Petstore API showcases typical RESTful interactions for managing a fictional pet store. By completing this guide, you'll learn how to interact with RESTful endpoints automatically generated by Zillabase based on an AsyncAPI 3.x specification. This guide will help you understand how to work with the generated API endpoints effectively â€” including making requests, understanding the expected payloads, and observing how data flows through the event-driven backend.
